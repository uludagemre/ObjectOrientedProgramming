 *    Purpose:  This class creates a generic animator.  Any 
 *    		object that implements the Drawable interface
 *		can be added to this animator, and will be called
 *		at regular intervals from the paint method.
 *
 *		This animator only provides the mechanism for a
 *		call back.  Actually drawing and moving the objects
 *		is the responsibility of the object registering with
 *		this animator.
