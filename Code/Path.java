 *              object should travel through, and then simply call the
 *              hasMoreSteps and nextPosition methods to walk through 
 *              the path.
 *		
 *		Note that in the Path could be a simple straight line, 
 *		a spline curve, a Bessel function, a Path with multiple
 *              segments, etc.
